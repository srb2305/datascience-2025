Data Cleaning

Overview
Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset. It's a crucial step in data analysis and machine learning to ensure that the data is reliable, accurate, and consistent.

Steps
1. Handling Missing Values: Identify and fill missing values using techniques like mean, median, or imputation.
2. Data Normalization: Scale numeric data to a common range to prevent differences in scales.
3. Removing Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate rows to prevent data redundancy.
4. Handling Outliers: Identify and handle outliers, which can be errors in data collection or unusual values.
5. Data Transformation: Convert data types, handle categorical variables, and perform feature scaling.

Techniques
1. Data Profiling: Analyze data distribution, summary statistics, and data quality.
2. Data Validation: Check data against rules, constraints, and business logic.
3. Data Standardization: Standardize data formats, units, and encoding.

Tools
1. Pandas: A popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
2. NumPy: A library for efficient numerical computation.
3. Data Cleaning Libraries: Libraries like pandas and Great Expectations provide built-in functions for data cleaning.

Example Code

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Name': ['John', 'Anna', np.nan, 'Linda'],
    'Age': [28, 24, 35, np.nan]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Handle missing values
df['Name'] = df['Name'].fillna('Unknown')
df['Age'] = df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].mean())

# Remove duplicates
df = df.drop_duplicates()

print("Cleaned DataFrame:")
print(df)


This code demonstrates basic data cleaning techniques using Pandas, including handling missing values and removing duplicates.
